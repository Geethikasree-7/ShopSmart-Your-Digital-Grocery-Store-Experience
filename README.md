 📘 Scenario-Based Case Study
 Scenario: A Family Preparing for the Weekend
 Background:  
 A user named Anusha is planning to host a small get-together this weekend. She needs to quickly buy groceries online without the hassle of visiting a crowded 
 supermarket.


 👩‍💻 Step-by-Step Interaction:

1. User Login:  
   Anusha logs in to the ShopSmart platform using her registered credentials.
2. Browsing Products:  
   She navigates to the “Shop” section and filters items by category such as vegetables, snacks, and beverages.
3. Adding to Cart:  
   She adds multiple products — tomatoes, chips, cold drinks — adjusting quantities for each item.
4. Reviewing Cart:  
   The “My Cart” section shows her selected items, quantities, and the total bill. She removes a duplicate item with one click.
5. Checkout:  
   She proceeds to the simulated checkout, confirms her order, and receives a success message.
6. Order History:  
   She checks the “Order History” to ensure her purchase is recorded and confirmed.

 📦 Admin Interaction:

Meanwhile, Anand, the store administrator:

- Logs into the admin panel.
- Views new orders placed by Anusha.
- Updates inventory by removing out-of-stock items.
- Adds a new product category: “Organic Essentials”.

This seamless flow shows how both customer and admin sides are integrated to form a real-world digital store experience.

 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 💳 Payment gateway integration 
- 📧 Email confirmation on order placement
- 📊 Admin dashboard with analytics
- 📦 Real-time stock management
- 🌐 Backend deployment via Render/Heroku
